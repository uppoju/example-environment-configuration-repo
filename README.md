# About
This repository contains two sample Gateway environments specified as  _dev_ and _test_, allowing you to create a dedicated environment configuration repository in GitHub so that you can  separate environment configuration from static Gateway policies and services for your Gateway solutions. 

In order to connect your configuration repository to the CI pipeline, you'll also need to install Weave Flux:
https://github.com/weaveworks/flux. 

Learn more about the steps to set up your configuration repository by visiting this repository's wiki page.
